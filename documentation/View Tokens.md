#View AutoTokens

A different type of token that renders a cshtml with a model.  To use them make sure your class implements AutoViewToken.  
You can follow the Getting Started document for all steps except the last.  Instead of defining the value and manually
compiling the markup you define a cshtml location and build a model for the view.
