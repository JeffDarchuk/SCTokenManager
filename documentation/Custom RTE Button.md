#TokenButton

There is a method to override for TokenButton that will automatically create a button for the default RTE profile for the particular token implementation.
Each TokenButton consists of three parts
1.  Name - identifier that will appear on mouse hover over the button.
2.  Icon - icon for the token button, in the same format as sitecore items.
3.  SortOrder - where in the RTE ribbon the button will show up, default is 1125.
